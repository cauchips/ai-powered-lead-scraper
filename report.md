## 1. Objective & Approach

The **AI-Powered Lead Scraper** project integrates two data sources:

1. **Live HTML Scraping**  
   - Business listings are collected from YellowPages, Yelp, and Manta (up to 10 results per source).  
   - Rotating User-Agent headers and 0.3-second delays are used to minimize blocking risk.  
   - FuzzyWuzzy deduplication ensures near-duplicate entries are removed.  

2. **Kaggle “BigPicture” Dataset**  
   - The “companies-2023-q4-sm.csv” file (approximately 17 million rows, ODC-By license) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.  
   - Only a subset (configurable via `USE_ROWS = 500000`) is imported to balance performance and coverage.  
   - A `country_name` column is derived from `country_code` using **pycountry**, enabling full-country name filtering (e.g., “United States”).

After merging scraped items with filtered Kaggle rows, each lead receives a **0–100 composite score** for prioritization.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Kaggle Subset**  
  - Columns selected: `name`, `industry`, `size`, `founded`, `city`, `state`, `country_code`.  
  - Null values in text fields are replaced with empty strings.  
  - The two-letter `country_code` is converted to `country_name` via pycountry for user-friendly location matching.

- **Filtering Logic**  
  - **Keyword** matching is performed as a case-insensitive substring search on `name` or `industry`.  
  - **Location** matching is performed as a case-insensitive substring search on `city`, `state`, or `country_name`.  
  - When provided, **Category** filters are applied to both scraped and Kaggle results.  
  - **Size Preference** is determined by converting Kaggle’s employee-range string into a numeric midpoint; inclusion is based on whether the midpoint falls within (or within 50% of) the chosen range.

- **Scraped Records**  
  - Yelp snippets (if available) are captured.  
  - Missing fields (`rating`, `year_founded`, `size`) are stored as `None`.

## 3. Scoring Model (0–100)

Each lead’s score is computed as the sum of six weighted components:

| Component               | Weight (%) | Calculation                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------|:----------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Age**                 |     20     | `(CurrentYear – founded) / 20`, capped at 1.0 → multiplied by 20. Companies older than 5 years receive full sub-score.                                                                                                  |
| **Size**                |     20     | If the size midpoint falls within the preferred range → 20; if within 50% proximity → 10; otherwise → 0.                                                                                                               |
| **Industry Fit**        |     15     | +15 if the user’s keyword appears (case-insensitive) in the `industry` field.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Sentiment**           |     10     | The DistilBERT SST-2 model (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) predicts P(positive) on the review snippet (or fallback “industry + location”). The probability is multiplied by 10 for this sub-score.    |
| **Rating**              |     15     | Yelp’s numerical rating (0–5 stars) is normalized by `(rating / 5) × 15`.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Semantic Similarity** |     20     | A SentenceTransformer model (“all-MiniLM-L6-v2”) is used to embed the lead’s text (`name + industry + location + first 200 characters of snippet`). Cosine similarity against an “ideal target” vector is computed, normalized to [0,1], then multiplied by 20. |

- **Total Score** = sum of sub-scores (range 0–100).  
- Leads are sorted in descending order by the total score.  
- A hoverable tooltip (“ⓘ” next to Score) provides a breakdown of these six components.

## 4. Performance & Evaluation

- **Execution Speed**  
  - Filtering 500,000 Kaggle rows via Pandas boolean masks completes in approximately 3–5 seconds locally.  
  - Live scraping (30 pages total) with 0.3-second delays completes in about 4–6 seconds.  
  - Embedding 500 leads with SentenceTransformer (“all-MiniLM-L6-v2”) requires around 1 second.  
  - Sentiment inference on 500 leads using DistilBERT SST-2 requires around 1 second.  
  - End-to-end runtime is approximately 8–10 seconds on a modern workstation.

- **Ranking Effectiveness**  
  - The 0–100 scoring scale produces few ties in the top 20 across various test queries (e.g., “Bakery Austin TX”).  
  - Manual inspection confirmed that older, mid-sized, positively reviewed, owner-operated businesses typically receive higher scores.  
  - The sidebar tooltip describing sub-score weights has been found to increase user trust and transparency.

- **Scalability**  
  - Increasing `USE_ROWS` to 1,000,000 raises filtering time to about 8 seconds. Index-based or FAISS-driven retrieval could be implemented for large-scale use.  
  - Additional scrapers or higher scraping volume would benefit from asynchronous requests or headless-browser fallbacks for CAPTCHAs.
